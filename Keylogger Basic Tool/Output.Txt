The output includes:

1. Captured Keyboard Inputs: Logs of all keys pressed on the keyboard.
2. Mouse Activity: Logs of mouse movements, clicks, and scrolls.
3. Screenshots: Periodic screenshots of the screen.
4. Microphone Recordings: Audio recordings captured by the microphone.
5. System Information: Information about the system such as hostname, IP address, and processor details.
6. Email Reports: All of the above information is sent periodically via email, based on the interval set by SEND_REPORT_EVERY.
7. If you want to print the output directly, you'd need to adjust the script to print the logs to the console instead of just appending them to a log variable or sending them via email.

Hereâ€™s how you might see the output directly:

1. Keyboard Logs: As the script runs, it records key presses. The log might look like:

2. Mouse Activity: Mouse movements and clicks might be logged as:

Mouse moved to 200 400
Mouse clicked at 300 500
Mouse scrolled at 250 450

3. Screenshots: The script captures and stores screenshots, which would be saved as image files.

4. Microphone Recordings: Audio would be recorded and stored as .wav files.
